Oh my god this assignment was so difficult for me.

I understood the idea of an object, and to be honest it's a super easy way to adapt to thinking. I now find myself thinking in "objects" more than not. I also did a lab in my other programming class where I used object oriented programming before I did this one, and I made a couple mistakes that I then knew not to make in here.

I think originally the idea I started with (which is not literally anything that you will see here because it really was THAT hard) was just too much and I started messing with it to try and make it easier to work with but instead of getting easier, it just got more condeluded and messed up and completely impossible to de-bug.

So I know this is a super easy way to do this lab, but I just got too ambitious and I wanted to do something more basic instead.

I took a lot from the coding examples and from Schiffman. I always make it a point to physically type out things I'm copying instead of copying and pasting because I feel like it gets it into my head more solidly.

Then I just had some minor debugging things to work on and I saw Dr. Musick and he fixed it all right up for me and it really was like one small thing that was wrong. I think I just got in my own way too much on this lab and I think the other things that are stressing me out just made me afraid to revisit this and try something easier. I think I have a really solid idea that I can build on for HW 12 though.
