This was pretty easy, and to be honest I feel like there was probably a more time intensive way to do this that could have simplified the functions a lot more but I'm gonna keep working on it.

I decided I would have three functions to control the three different things this drawing needed. One function to set up the circles in the grid pattern, one to draw them (and color specific ones red) and one to change which circles were being colored red, which I sort of inaccurately named "moveCircles" because they aren't really moving.

It turns out that having a function to move the circles was kind of pointless because only like one line of code actually worked staying in the function and I had to place some other elements of that process outside of the function inside of draw.

My computer science teacher Michael helps me a lot with these assignments during my CS100 lab and he helped me figure out I was defining the functions again inside draw when I meant to just be calling them and he also helped me understand why my variables weren't being recognized when they were inside of functions. 

The thing that I had the most trouble with this assignment was definitely my fault, I should have been more organized when I was creating my code for the first time because I just made a copy of my previous assignment and just started copying and pasting like crazy, so I didn't know what brackets went with what and if stuff was open or closed, it was very dumb of me, I should have just been more careful. I also didn't pay a lot of attention to where I was defining variables which also became something I needed help with but I feel like I knew better than to not pay attention to that haha.

Overall, like I said, I literally just took all my code that was already there and put it into functions, which is fine, but I also feel like with a littl more effort I could have created a more efficient way to perform the tasks in the first place, I just didn't have time to commit to trying that. I want to keep working on this and understanding it though because I already have a lot of ideas of things I can make better by using functions.
