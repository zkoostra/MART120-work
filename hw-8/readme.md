Oh my god this assignment just took me forever. Sorry it's super late.

So what I originally wanted to do was do what I wound up doing except with hearts instead of with circles. I thought that would be cool, but it was just really hard to do the heart which I also didn't know how to do within the other stuff I was learning.

So anyway, I started out with a basic framework to create a grid of circles and then change the color of one column of circles at a time. I used a grid setup that was used earlier in the lesson and just tweaked it to what I needed. This is where I used the for loop, which was not really a difficult concept for me. I got it right away, I built my grid. Then I originally tried to draw another row of circles onto the top of the other circles so I wouldn't have to change the color but that turned out to be really difficult and annoying.

I went to office hours and Professor Musick helped me. He always does lol. Bless him. I think what messed me up is that I did orginally want to use a for loop to draw this second set of circles which didn't really make sense in the end. I wound up doing something way simpler, which is using an if statement to tell the circles to turn red when their x value was equal to a variable I was increasing each frame.

I think next week I'm gonna try and do this again but I'm gonna do it the way I envisioned it the first time, with the heart.
