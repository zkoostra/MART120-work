["Hello World!" Sketch] https://zkoostra.github.io/MART120-work/HW-3/
The homework I did this cycle got a lot more intense than last week. A lot of the homework this week was reading and watching videos to maybe scratch the surface of what we're supposed to understand in this assignment. Then I created my hello world page. I found that looking back and forth between the code I was writing and the code on the website was really tedious but also really helpful. I am already starting to understand the patterns in the code, and when it came time to set the color, I settled on "turquoise" but I did play with using RGB values to create colors, which was demonstrated on one of the p5 pages. I also chose to make my color canvas more horizontal and I made my "Hello World" message a little more personal.

It was really annoying but I just looked at the code and typed it out the exact same way but with my own changes. It took a long time, but it felt really good to see my message to the world show up when it started working.

Then I started the process of getting my code onto github and boy was that terrible. My github app decided for some reason that I shouldn't be allowed to log in even though I had the right username and password. I tried a bunch of different things on Wednesday night but I couldn't figure it out. I posted on the forum and actually quite a few people responded, but I wound up having to go to office hours and Michael helped me figure it out. After like 30 minutes and a lot of swearing, we finally had my repo up on git.

I then encountered a small problem with my link, I kept typing in hw-3 at the end of my url and it wasn't working. Then, I realized my file was actually called HW-3 so that's what's in my link.

I mean I think at this point there's a lot of things that are up for further discussion, I know we're just beginning, but currently I understand what we're doing and understand the process by which we got to where we are right now.

I also didn't help anyone with anything this week, but nobody really needed help! A couple people but they always resolved it before I got there.
