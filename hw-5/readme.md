So this week I created an animated sketch, yay! I tried to keep it really, really simple because last week I got way too complicated and involved and I overwhelmed myself really easily.

So, it's not like an amazing, crazy thing but I made an animation with a paper airplane and a rock lol.

First, I made a list of all the stuff I needed to do for this project. I made a list of the requirements, then I made a list for all the different pieces of code I would need for the various parts of my project. I included code for each shape and what it would entail, for example the rock is an arc, so I wrote that I'd need to code an arc, etc. Then I created all of my shapes first, then created the variables that would help them move. I did almost all of this by myself but I did have to stop in to office hours to tweak the animation settings.

Eventually, I figured out that to move my rock, I had to input the X coordinates for the beginning of my arc as my variable plus 1. Making the triangle move was actually kind of difficult too but I wound up making the first point the same x and y coordinates as the mouse and then the other points were values + the x and y coordinates. Now that I've done it, it totally makes sense in my head. I think this is a little bit difficult sometimes because there's no one to verbalize with, maybe I should get a code study group or something.

I'd obviously like to keep learning more about animations, and I would LOVE to know if there's any type of program where I can plot stuff on a grid and then use it to help input the correct coordinates in the code. So HMU if ya know anything about that.

During lab hours I did help a girl uninstall and reinstall atom, so I count that as helping a classmate.
