Ugh. I can't make this project do what I want it to and I don't know a way to test if the objects aren't interacting and that's why it's not working or if it's my order of operations. I've tried moving things around but I don't know what's causing my bubbles to not change colors.

Here's what my project was supposed to be:
There are two object classes of bubble. FirstBubble is the bubble all the other bubbles test their distance from. The other bubbles are just regular bubbles in an array. I wanted them to be made from the same object class but i was having a hard time thinking through how to do it. Now that my code semi-works again I think I could edit it back down to being one class but I'd have to change all the variables again and that sounds like asking for it.
The bubbles in the array were supposed to change what shade of purple they were based on their distance from the FirstBubble. I used the map function to map those distances to values 0-100 and then used the HSL color mode to make the bubbles go from dark purple to like a lilac type shade. They should have started out dark and gotten lighter. I'm pissed because it should have been really beautiful.

To be honest, I am not really having any trouble understanding this homework, in my life however, I've just bitten off more than I can chew in general and haven't been able to devote the kind of time I want to it, which is why I didn't have time to consult someone about why this didn't work and I am instead turning it in broken and lame.

I wish I had been able to try something more complicated, where objects interact with each other and then move in a certain way or something. I also am getting a better understanding of arrays finally, I've worked with them for two weeks now and I think I finally get it and I get how to cycle through an array to get each of the individual objects to do something.

Overall, I am still happy to be learning and growing in this class, I had a great semester and I'm definitely going to stick with coding and learn more.
