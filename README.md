# MART120-work
This is a collection of Zoie's work for MART120, Creative Coding I.
# Weekly Response for Feb 2
1. This homework cycle, I didn't make a ton of individual choices. I mostly followed all of the lesson instructions to the letter because coding is very new for me and quite scary so having exact processes to follow was actually very good and made things easy and simple and sort of comforting.
2. I accidentally answered this already I guess but I really just followed the instructions on the course website. I downloaded Atom, I downloaded the GitHub Desktop, I created my different files and practiced comitting them to the cloud.
3. This week I really didn't have any problems. It especially helped that there were screenshots of all the processes I was going through and what they looked like on a mac. I did complain about all the emails I was getting on the forum but I just decided to stop watching the thread and check in manually each day instead.
4. I'm actually really interested in learning more about markup. The website briefly discussed uses for it, but I'd like to learn some more or learn if there's anything fun I can do to get more used to writing in it.
5. To my classmates credit, I don't think the last homework cycle warranted too many questions haha. But hopefully I'll have a chance over the coming week to help out with more things.
