Here is my project proposal! Yay!

How many of you here are Broad City fans? Everyone should be a Broad City fan. I want to do my project to mimic the style of the title sequences for that show, which are like very colorful, wiggly, weird animations that form into their logo to this super catchy music.

I want mine to obviously say something else, I am not making free content for Broad City haha, I'm just inspired by this colorful, goofy animation. I googled the titles' artist to see if he talked anywhere about how he created the art, and it's all hand drawn in Photoshop and then animated with After Effects, so I'm worried I won't be able to do it very efficiently in p5. I also am not an amazing artist so drawing them by hand and using p5 just to animate it also sounds very terrible lol.

I am hoping I can either load letter's I've already created into the animation or somehow connect it with a font, and then I'll have several "title cards" that just say different things (probably just random stuff I think is funny or maybe a words of encouragement type thing) and have different animations that go with them. They either can change when the person does something (like clicks or does a drop down like a couple of the examples?) or just play one after the other.

So here's a list of things I think I need/things I need to do for this project.
1. Find out if this is possible lol.
2. Figure out how to make my letters or generate them in draw.
3. Figure out how to animate shapes that are irregular, like formations or weird blobs so it's not all just circles and squares.
4. Decide if I want the same song/ find music to set this to.
5. Figure out how to set it to music.
6. Storyboard animations so I know what everything should look like and say.
7. Make the thing.

PS I talked to Michael today (4/30) and I've gotten an extension to next Friday on this project. I'll be emailing another note just wanted to list here also since my lazy ass hasn't turned this thing in lol.
